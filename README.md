## What is this?
A simple Sketch plugin to generate and maintain artboard-based changelogs for our Sketch Master Templates and Libraries.

You run it, it asks you what changed in your design, your name and it creates (or updates) an artboard with your commits.

Every page in your Sketch file has its own changelog. The changelog title is always synched with the title of the page it is in. Thereâ€™s no global changelog for the whole file but only page specific ones.

The shortcut for running the changelog is `ctrl + alt + C`.
